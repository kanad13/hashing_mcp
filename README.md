# Hashing MCP Server Package

This repository provides an installable Python package containing a straightforward [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. It offers tools to calculate MD5 and SHA-256 cryptographic hashes for text data, designed for easy integration with MCP clients like VS Code Copilot Chat, Claude for Desktop, or other LLM interfaces supporting the protocol.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves two main purposes:

1.  **Provides a ready-to-use `hashing-mcp` server package:** You can install this package directly to add hashing capabilities to your MCP-enabled application. See **Installation** and **Usage** sections below.
2.  **Acts as an educational resource:** It includes detailed guides to help you understand MCP concepts and learn how this specific server was built. See the **Learning More** section below.

## Key Features

- Provides an MCP tool `calculate_md5` for MD5 hashing.
- Provides an MCP tool `calculate_sha256` for SHA-256 hashing.
- Runs as an MCP server using `stdio` transport, ideal for desktop clients.
- Installable as a standard Python package (`pip install hashing-mcp`).
- Provides a command-line entry point (`hashing-mcp-server`) to easily start the server.

## Learning More

This repository also contains detailed guides for understanding and building MCP servers:

- **Conceptual Guide:** To understand the Model Context Protocol (MCP), its architecture, and its role in Agentic AI, please read:
  - [docs/understanding-mcp.md](docs/understanding-mcp.md)
- **Step-by-Step Tutorial:** To learn how this `hashing-mcp` server package is structured and built (including Python packaging), follow the tutorial:
  - [docs/tutorial-build-mcp-server.md](docs/tutorial-build-mcp-server.md)
    _(Note: This guide walks through creating the package structure found in this repository.)_

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed. I recommend using a virtual environment.

**Using `uv` (Recommended):**

```bash
# Create a new directory (optional, but good practice)
mkdir my_mcp_setup && cd my_mcp_setup

# Create virtual environment and activate it
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows

# Install the package
uv pip install hashing-mcp
```

**Using `pip`:**

```bash
# Create a new directory (optional, but good practice)
mkdir my_mcp_setup && cd my_mcp_setup

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
# Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):
# .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package
pip install hashing-mcp
```

## Usage

Once the package is installed and your virtual environment is activated, you can start the MCP server.

**1. Run the Server:**

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
hashing-mcp-server
```

This command starts the server, which will listen for MCP requests via standard input/output (stdio). You typically won't interact with this terminal directly after starting it; your MCP client will communicate with it in the background. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

**2. Configure Your MCP Client:**

Configure your MCP client (e.g., VS Code, Claude Desktop) to use the installed `hashing-mcp-server`. The key is to tell the client the **exact command** needed to run the server script.

- **Find the Executable Path:** After activating your virtual environment, find the absolute path to the installed script:

  - On Linux/macOS: `which hashing-mcp-server`
  - On Windows: `where hashing-mcp-server`
  - Copy the full path output by the command.

- **Example: VS Code (`settings.json`)**

  _**Important:** Replace `/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/hashing-mcp-server` with the **actual absolute path** you found above._

  ```json
  // In your VS Code settings.json (User or Workspace)
  "mcp": {
      "servers": {
          // You can name this key anything, e.g., "hasher" or "cryptoTools"
          "hashing": {
              // Use the full, absolute path to the executable within your virtual environment
              "command": "/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/hashing-mcp-server"
              // No 'args' needed when running the installed script directly
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- **Example: Other Clients (Claude, OpenAI Agents, etc.)**

  Follow the specific instructions for your client application. When asked for the command or path to the MCP server, provide the **full absolute path** to the `hashing-mcp-server` executable you found earlier. Refer to their documentation:

  - [Claude for Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)
  - [Open AI ChatGPT Agents (via Python)](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/)

**3. Test the Integration:**

Once configured, ask your MCP client questions that should trigger the tools:

- "Calculate the MD5 hash of the text 'hello world'"
- "What is the SHA256 hash for the string 'MCP is cool!'?"
- "Use the calculate_sha256 tool on this sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

The client should identify the request, invoke the `hashing-mcp-server` via the configured command, and display the calculated hash result.

## Development (Contributing)

If you want to modify or contribute to this package:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kanad13/MCP-Server-for-Hashing.git
    cd MCP-Server-for-Hashing
    ```
2.  **Set up the development environment (using uv):**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate virtual environment
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ```
3.  **Install in editable mode with development dependencies:**
    Install the package such that changes in `src/` are reflected immediately. Also installs optional dependencies defined under `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]` in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `pytest`, `ruff`).
    ```bash
    uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```
    _(Make sure to add relevant tools like `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy` to the `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]` section in `pyproject.toml` if you haven't already)._
4.  **Run the server during development:**
    You can run the server using the script (available due to `-e`):
    ```bash
    hashing-mcp-server
    ```
    Or execute the module directly:
    ```bash
    python -m hashing_mcp.cli
    ```
